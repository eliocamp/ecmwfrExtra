# The Problem

## Introduction
- Introduce ECMWF
- Introduce various data products and interfaces (currently pooled in the ecmwfr package)

## The issue
- The data access options (current focus on python)
- Although ecmwfr gives basic access, no derivative functions are provided
  - limit user replication of common functions (spatial subsets)
  - provide readily available and common statistics 
    - extreme value theory
    - long term means
    - ...
...

## Who does it affect

- climate scientists
- policy makers
- ecologists
- hydrologists

broad scope, both across fields as specially

## Previous attempts

- no

## Why should it be tackled?

- scope of functions is broader than cloud based solutions
- more control
- reproducibility of analysis and distribution of processing routines
