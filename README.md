# ecmwfrExtra proposal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/khufkens/ecmwfrExtra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/khufkens/ecmwfrExtra)

The ecmwfr R package provides an easy interface to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 'ECMWF' web API services and Copernicus Climate Data Store or 'CDS'data. The package itself is singularly focussed on providing raw data. The package therefore addresses a growing need to interface with 'ECMWF' web API services within the R community.

As a consequence of the singular focus of the 'ecmwfr' package, derivative uses of the data are left to the respective users of the package. Yet, many climate related indices are well established and cut across various disciplines. For example the [Palmer Drought Severity Index] (PDSI) is used in agricultural advisory, academic research and insurance providers alike.

Given the multi-disciplinary reach of ECMWF data I hope to collect a diverse sampling of common indices or operation upon climate data leveraging 'ECMWF' data as queried through the 'ecmwfr' package. I call upon the R user community of ECMWF data to contribute initial ideas on how to develop this further. The goal is to get an overview of the needs and wants of ECMWF (R) users, as to faciliate a potential workshop or hack-a-ton to make the most common requests and those with a global impact a reality through a R-Consortium sponsored initiative.

Please leave ideas and suggestions as issues in this project. Please check previous suggestions before submitting a new one.
